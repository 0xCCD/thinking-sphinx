* [FEATURE] Default settings for index definition arguments can be set in config/thinking_sphinx.yml.

* [FIX] Suppressing delta output in test helpers now works (Darcy Laycock).
* [FEATURE] A custom Riddle/Sphinx controller can be supplied. Useful for Flying Sphinx to have an API layer over Sphinx commands, without needing custom gems for different Thinking Sphinx/Flying Sphinx combinations.
